\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>When I visit the free sample calendar it still says “Check back soon for today's free sample”- Why is that?</h4>
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you are seeing the \"Check back soon\" message it is because we either have not yet posted today’s sample find or your Internet browser has saved that image on your computer. Browsers often do this to increase their speed and efficiency for websites you visit often. We post a daily free sample find every morning between 9 and 10 AM. If you still see the “Check back” message at that time, try refreshing your Internet browser or close your browser completely then reopen it again.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>When I went to request the sample it said they were out or that I didn’t qualify to get the sample.</h4>
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We sometimes offer exclusive free samples through allyou.com, but often we are scouting out other free samples being offered by other companies. Since most of these samples have no affiliation with All You, we make sure to the best of our ability the requesting process is simple and strait-forward before we post the sample. We want you to trust the sites we find and know they are legitimate, however, since these are not All You sites, we cannot control the quantity of samples, length of the offer or changes to the qualifications for receiving the sample after we post our daily find.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>The free sample site won't work for me.

</h4>
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sometimes theses sites are built with a program called Flash or may have pop-up windows (or both). Make sure you have the Macromedia Flash plug in (it’s a free update that most newer browsers come with, but not all) and you do not block pop-up windows.

</h4>
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We strive to find the best free sample offers from around the Web every day and sometimes those samples are found on Facebook. We in no way want to alienate our readers who choose not to use Facebook, but many companies and brands use Facebook as a means of communicating with their audience and to distribute their free samples.
